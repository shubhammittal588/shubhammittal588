ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shubham Mittal, an Associate Software Engineer at Bosch with a passion for crafting high-quality mobile and web applications. With over two years of experience in iOS development, I specialize in optimizing app performance, enhancing user interfaces, and building robust automotive solutions in fast-paced, agile environments.

ðŸŒ± I have a strong foundation in Swift, C++, JavaScript, and SAP ABAP, with additional hands-on experience in ReactJS and Flutter. My recent projects include developing an iOS game, a weather app with real-time API integration, and a venue meta search platform.

ðŸ“ˆ I enjoy pushing the boundaries of app performance and was able to reduce the size of an iOS app by 40MB in a recent internship, improving both speed and user experience. Iâ€™m driven by data and analytics to make decisions that elevate user satisfaction.

ðŸ“« Reach me on LinkedIn or browse my projects right here on GitHub!
